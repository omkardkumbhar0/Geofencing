# 🗺️ Simple Geofencing with HTML + Leaflet

This project is a **pure HTML file** implementation of a **geofencing system** using [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and the **Geolocation API**.  
It allows you to:

- ✅ See your **current location** on a map  
- ✅ **Add fences** by clicking on the map (with approval popup)  
- ✅ **Remove fences** easily  
- ✅ See all added fences listed on the right side  
- ✅ Get a **notification when you enter a fence area**
